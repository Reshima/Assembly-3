# Assembly-3
This program runs a subroutine that sorts a stack as integers are entered into it. The user will enter an integer to indicate how many numbers they want in the stack.
The program will then prompt the user to enter in an integer for however many times the user wanted. When the integer is entered it is automatically sorted into the stack.
The program will print out the sorted stack in decesending order, then reset the stack to it's starting point and terminate.
